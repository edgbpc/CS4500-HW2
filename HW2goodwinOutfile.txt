Dice Rolling Simulation - 
Program simulates navigating of a pyramid of integers using a four sided die.
Number of the die indicates direction to travel on the pyramid.  If there is a valid location to travel to
then the location is updated and that location is marked as visited.  Every visit is recorded.
If a move is not valid, counts as another visit at the current location.
Game continues until all locations are visited.
When game terminates, vital statistics are reported.
